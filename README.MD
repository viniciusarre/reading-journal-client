# About this project

## The main idea

The goal of this project is to fulfil a personal use case for an interactive way of saving my reading notes and keep them in a single place where they can be accessed.

The idea basically is to create an interactive note-taking service but focused on a book's metadata and chapters / sections. 

## The tech stack 

In order to accomplish this, as well as learning new technologies and expanding my search for better technologies, I intend on using TypeScript with Vue 3 which will consume a GraphQL API (potentially using Apollo).
